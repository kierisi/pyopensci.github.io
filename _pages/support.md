    title: "Scientists need open source software to support open science"
    excerpt: "Open science workflows allow scientists to build upon one another’s work which in turn accelerates scientific discovery. Free and open software lowers open science barriers by allowing scientists to freely access the tools that they need to process their data."
foundation:

    alt: ""
    excerpt: "pyOpenSci builds a diverse community that supports the scientific Python software that scientists need for open science. Our  [peer review program](about-peer-review/), packaging support, and training helps scientists build better, maintainable and trusted open source tools.

    ### Diverse community is the heart of our work

    Diversity in open source is even lower than it is in the broader tech community. But, it doesn’t have to be this way. pyOpenSci carves out space for people to participate through mentorship programs and training. We also actively create welcoming, supportive, safe, and inclusive spaces where all members feel represented, heard, and valued."

Their mission is to “make the world a better place by advancing the frontiers of knowledge. We pledge to pursue that mission in ways that make the institutions of scientific endeavor more diverse, more equitable, and more inclusive to all."

Our mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for everyone. "
