# Your funding of pyOpenSci directly supports diversity in open source and open science

pyOpenSci builds a diverse community that supports the scientific Python software that scientists need for open science. Our  peer review program, packaging support, and training helps scientists build better, maintainable and trusted open source tools.

## Open source and open science are intertwined

Science is now data-driven. At pyOpenSci we value open science workflows because they allow scientists to build upon one another’s work and accelerate advancements, rather than spending time reinventing the wheel. Free and open software lowers open science barriers by allowing scientists to freely access the tools that they need to process their data.

## Diverse community is the heart of our work

Diversity in open source is even lower than it is in the broader tech community.  There is a lack of diversity across all segments in both tech and open source. But, it doesn’t have to be this way. pyOpenSci actively creates welcoming, supportive, safe, and inclusive spaces where all members feel represented, heard, and valued.


## Give today

pyOpenSci is currently seeking corporate and institutional sponsors. Your fiscal contribution will directly support the pyOpenSci mission by funding programs that:
- Improve the quality and usability of scientific Python software through community-driven open peer review
- Diversify and empower the  community through training and mentorship
- Build community capacity to contribute to open software
- Create supportive community for those developing scientific Python software that scientists need

To learn more about how you can support pyOpenSci, please email [admin@pyopensci.org](admin@pyopensci.org).
