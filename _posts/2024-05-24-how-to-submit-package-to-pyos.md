# Congratulations, you’ve created a package!
Celebrate hard work

> Call-out: link to pyOS packaging guide for those looking to get started//get help building a package

# What pyOS looks for in a package (checklist style? Pull from author guide)
## Technical
## “Human” (maintain for 2 years, answer questions, etc.)
# Choosing your issue
* Screenshot of software-submission page, create a decision tree graphic
* Help request explanation
* Pre-submission inquiry explanation
* A note on data visualization packages—all data viz packages should go through pre-submission inquiry (to evaluate scope?)

Overview of the GitHub UI
Labels

Markdown basics
Call-out: link to Markdown 101 resource (could make a nice quick blog post, too)
What is an issue template?
Standardizes the submission process
Etiquette:
Keep things as they are–don’t delete, rearrange, reformat….
Anything else?

# Step-by-step: filling out the submission for review issue template
Fill out an exemplar issue that someone can follow along with. Use two images side-by-side: blank (before) and filled-in (after), going section by section
Logistics:
Submit all at once
Recommend reading through a few times, but at a high level, in addition to having your package, you’ll want to know:
Scope of your package (see categories)
Target audience
Scientific applications of the package
Other packages that accomplish the same thing (if any), and how yours is different
Let’s start at the very beginning: writing a title
Keeping it simple
Package name: short description
Header
You fill out author, maintainers, name, one-liner, repo link, version submitted
You don’t need to worry about: editor, reviewer 1, reviewer 2, archive, JOSS DOI, version accepted, or date accepted
Code of Conduct and Commitment to Maintain
Link to CoC, etc. in tutorial
Provide highlights
Description
Scope
Is there more information I can provide here about what we do and do not accept?
Domain specific
Community Partnerships
How to know if your package is associated with an existing community
Technical checks
Links to OSI approved license information
Explain what each component is and why it's important for submission
Submitting to JOSS
Links from issue in tutorial
Submitting directly to your repo
Why we ask this
Confirmation
Link to author guide
Survey
How it helps pyOS
How long it takes to fill out
Feedback
Let us know what you like, dislike, and would like to see changed
Editor and Review templates
Not something you need to worry about!

# What’s next: the waiting game
Relax, be ready (to make adjustments)
Once submit, EIC reviews package for scope and infrastructure
Takes about two weeks
May take longer if changes need to be implemented
Entire process can take approximately 3 months, but can also take considerably longer–entirely package-dependent
